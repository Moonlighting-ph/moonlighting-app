# Backend Structure Document

## Introduction

The backend of Moonlighting.ph plays a crucial role in powering the entire platform that connects understaffed healthcare providers with pre-vetted, on-demand medical professionals. It is the engine that manages everything from user registrations, secure verifications, and job postings to handling payments and real-time notifications. By keeping the architecture robust yet easy to understand, even non-technical stakeholders can appreciate how all the moving parts come together to provide a seamless experience for providers and moonlighters alike.

## Backend Architecture

The architecture of the backend is designed to be both secure and scalable. At its core, the system leverages Supabase—a powerful platform that provides database management, authentication, and storage in a single integrated solution. This architecture supports modern design patterns such as microservices and serverless functions where needed, ensuring that the application remains maintainable while adapting to increased usage. Complementing this is the integration of AI components like GPT-4 for smart job matching and form assistance, which seamlessly work alongside the core business logic to provide a highly responsive experience.

## Database Management

Supabase uses a PostgreSQL database that serves as the main repository for all application data. This database is structured to efficiently manage relational data such as user profiles, job posts, shift records, payment statuses, and notification logs. Data is organized in clear, interrelated tables with strict access controls, ensuring that sensitive healthcare and personal data is handled securely. Moreover, consistent practices for data encryption both in transit and at rest are in place, ensuring compliance with local regulatory standards such as the Data Privacy Act of 2012 and HITECH requirements.

## API Design and Endpoints

The platform’s APIs are designed with clarity and simplicity in mind, adhering to RESTful principles to ensure that each endpoint performs a clear and specific function. Key endpoints include user authentication and management, job posting and listing services, and integration endpoints for payments through Stripe and PayMongo. In addition, there are dedicated endpoints for real-time notifications which support in-app alerts as well as SMS and email updates for urgent communications. This well-organized API structure enables smooth communication between the frontend interface and the backend services, ensuring that every interaction is reliable and swift.

## Hosting Solutions

The backend is hosted in a cloud-based environment that is scalable, secure, and cost-effective. Using cloud platforms like those provided by Supabase ensures that the services are continuously available and can handle increases in traffic without performance degradation. This managed hosting approach minimizes the operational overhead, allowing the development team to focus on building and enhancing platform features rather than managing infrastructure. Additionally, this setup benefits from robust backup solutions and global content delivery networks (CDNs), ensuring reliability and optimal performance for users across the Philippines.

## Infrastructure Components

Several key components come together to form the resilient infrastructure of Moonlighting.ph. Load balancers help distribute incoming traffic evenly across servers, which is particularly important during peak usage periods. Caching mechanisms and CDNs are employed to speed up the delivery of static assets such as images and JavaScript files, ensuring a snappy user experience. Additionally, robust communication channels exist for sending real-time alerts, and a secure reverse proxy setup manages API requests to shield the backend from unnecessary load and potential security threats. These components work in tandem to create a reliable, high-performance backend environment.

## Security Measures

Security is a cornerstone of the backend setup, especially given the sensitivity of healthcare and personal data. The platform leverages strong authentication protocols via Supabase, including token-based methods, to manage access rights for various user roles such as providers, moonlighters, support staff, and super admins. Data encryption is enforced both in transit through TLS and at rest within the database. Regular security audits, combined with detailed logging and alert systems, help to quickly identify and address any potential vulnerabilities. Furthermore, specific measures such as automated PRC License Verification with a manual appeal process ensure that only eligible professionals can access and use the platform.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

To guarantee continuous and reliable performance, a suite of monitoring tools is integrated into the system. These tools track server health, API response times, transaction logs, and real-time user interactions, enabling the team to identify issues before they impact users significantly. Maintenance strategies include scheduled updates, automated backup routines, and proactive security patching. In addition, the administrative dashboard provides real-time insights and control over system operations, which is essential for managing user disputes, content moderation, and compliance checks.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

The backend architecture of Moonlighting.ph is thoughtfully engineered to meet the project’s goals of reliability, scalability, and security. By leveraging a modern cloud-based environment powered by Supabase, the platform efficiently manages everything from user authentication and real-time notifications to secure data storage and API integrations with third-party services like Stripe and PayMongo. The combination of robust security measures, clear API design, and a scalable hosting solution ensures that the system not only meets current requirements but is also prepared for future expansion. This comprehensive setup lays a strong foundation for a seamless and secure user experience for all stakeholders involved.

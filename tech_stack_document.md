# Tech Stack Document

## Introduction

Moonlighting.ph is an innovative platform that connects understaffed hospitals, clinics, and in-home care services with pre-vetted, on-demand medical professionals. The project is designed to streamline the entire process of shift hiring, application management, and in-app payments. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, the platform meets the needs of busy healthcare providers and skilled moonlighters who require a reliable, efficient way to manage staffing challenges and work opportunities. Decisions made in the tech stack are intended to ensure a robust, secure, and user-friendly experience for both technical and non-technical users alike.

## Frontend Technologies

The user interface is built using Next.js 14 and TypeScript. Next.js is chosen for its fast server-side rendering and improved performance that directly benefits dynamic job listings and real-time notifications. TypeScript adds reliability with clearer code and fewer errors, making development more maintainable over time. The styling is handled with Tailwind CSS, which offers a modern, flexible approach to design without the overhead of writing custom CSS from scratch. Additionally, shadcn/UI, Radix UI, and Lucide Icons are incorporated to ensure that the user interface is clean, intuitive, and accessible. These components work harmoniously to create a pleasing and interactive experience that resonates with the project’s modern design preferences and ease of user navigation.

## Backend Technologies

The backend is powered primarily by Supabase, which provides an integrated solution for database management, authentication, and file storage. Supabase is a reliable choice because it simplifies real-time data operations and streamlines access control, which are critical for ensuring that sensitive healthcare and staffing data remain secure. The platform also leverages GPT-4 for AI-driven features such as matching job postings with the most suitable candidates and assisting providers in form filling. These components work together to manage shift booking, handle job applications, monitor payment statuses, and support administrative tasks all in one cohesive ecosystem.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

The project benefits from modern infrastructure choices that emphasize scalability and ease of deployment. With Next.js and Supabase at the core, the deployment likely utilizes cloud hosting platforms that support continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) routines, ensuring that new updates are rolled out seamlessly. Though specific hosting platforms are not detailed, the tech choices ensure that the system is set up for rapid scaling in response to user demand, supporting peak loads of at least 1,000 concurrent users. Version control systems and automated pipelines are employed to maintain code quality and to streamline iterative releases, all of which contribute to the overall stability and reliability of the platform.

## Third-Party Integrations

Moonlighting.ph integrates several critical third-party services to extend its functionality. Payment processing is managed through Stripe and PayMongo APIs, which allow for secure in-app payments and direct payouts to moonlighters. In addition to payments, the platform integrates with external services such as the PRC License Portal for automatic license verification, and additional tools for real-time email notifications and SMS alerts. Calendar synchronization with services like Google Calendar and Outlook is incorporated to help users keep track of upcoming shifts and recurring job schedules. These integrations ensure that the platform not only meets the core needs of its users but also enhances their experience by simplifying routine tasks.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Given the sensitive nature of healthcare data, robust security practices are embedded into every layer of the tech stack. The system adheres to strict security standards that include data encryption both in transit and at rest, regular security audits, and stringent access controls to comply with local regulations such as the Data Privacy Act of 2012 and HITECH requirements. In terms of performance, every technology selected – from Next.js’s optimized rendering to Supabase’s real-time data handling – plays a role in ensuring that the user experience is smooth and responsive. The platform is designed to manage significant loads, with rigorous testing to support real-time updates, instant notifications, and detailed analytics, which keeps the system responsive even as user numbers scale.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

The tech stack of Moonlighting.ph has been carefully crafted to support a modern, secure, and scalable platform. The frontend is built using Next.js 14 and TypeScript, enhanced by Tailwind CSS and a suite of UI libraries that work together to create an intuitive experience. The backend, supported by Supabase, handles core functions such as authentication, data storage, and real-time operations. Critical integrations, including GPT-4 for smart matching and Stripe and PayMongo for payment processing, further empower the platform to deliver an efficient staffing solution. With a strong focus on security, compliance, and performance, this tech stack not only meets the needs of today but is also well-prepared for future expansion and increased user demand. The thoughtful combination of these technologies is what sets Moonlighting.ph apart as a reliable and cutting-edge solution in the healthcare staffing industry.

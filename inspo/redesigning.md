Prompt for Redesigning Moonlighting.ph Dashboards and Components
Objective:
Revamp the design, UI/UX, and overall user experience of the Moonlighting.ph platform’s dashboards and components to match the attached visual designs—especially the first image, which reflects the current landing page design (hosted separately). The goal is to create a cohesive, modern, and user-friendly experience across the entire platform.

Key Requirements:

Visual Identity & Branding:

Color Scheme: Adopt the color palette shown in the attached image. Use the primary and accent colors consistently across headers, buttons, backgrounds, and typography.
Typography: Use the fonts and sizes depicted in the design image. Ensure headings, body text, and CTAs have clear hierarchy and are easy to read.
Iconography: Incorporate the style of icons (line icons, filled icons, etc.) from the attached designs. Icons should be consistent in style and color.
Layout & Structure:

Landing Page: Use the first attached image as the primary reference for the landing page. This design should set the tone for the rest of the platform.
Dashboards: Update the dashboards (both for providers and moonlighters) to reflect a similar layout, with clear sections for job listings, application statuses, and user data.
Responsive Design: Ensure all components are optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
UI Components & Interactions:

Navigation: Redesign the header, sidebar, and footer to match the new visual identity. Navigation should be intuitive and clearly highlight the active section.
Forms & Inputs: Update all form elements (e.g., registration forms, payment forms, job application forms) to use the new design guidelines. Ensure a clean, minimalist look with clear focus states.
Buttons & CTAs: Redesign buttons to have consistent styles (rounded corners, hover effects, etc.) based on the attached image. Primary actions should be highly visible.
Animations: Include smooth transitions and hover animations similar to those in the design images to enhance the user experience.
User Experience & Flow:

Consistency: Ensure a cohesive look and feel across all pages, including the landing page, job boards, profile pages, and payment modules.
Ease of Navigation: Design clear visual cues for navigation and interaction. All critical functions (job search, application status, profile management) should be easily accessible.
User Feedback: Incorporate clear success and error states that align with the overall design aesthetic.
Future-Proofing:

Scalability: Build the design in a modular way so that new features (e.g., automated payments with Stripe/PayMongo) can be integrated without major design overhauls.
Documentation: Update the design guidelines and component library documentation to reflect the new style, ensuring consistency for future development.
Deliverables:

Design Mockups/Prototypes: Updated visual designs for the landing page, dashboards, and key UI components based on the attached images.
Updated Design Guidelines Document: A revised document outlining color schemes, typography, layout, and interaction details.
Implementation Plan: A step-by-step plan to integrate these design changes into the current codebase, including any necessary refactoring of components.
Notes:

Use the first attached image as the main inspiration for the landing page design, ensuring that its modern, clean, and engaging look carries over into all other parts of the platform.
Pay special attention to consistency in spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy across all components.
Keep the design user-centric with clear, intuitive navigation and immediate visual feedback for interactions.
